# lotoAnalysis
A loto game to help a master1 pyschology study.
 
This code was updated, with minimal time, to help a psychology student to finalise her study involving test users.

This tool is originally written in Vanilla JS. So are the few updates I performed.
The internal code is not ideal, but at least for a very short project it works with minimal investment.

To run The loto game, just downalod all files and open the .html file into chrome / firefox or any moderne web browser.
